<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    The goal in this course is to build upon the studentâ€™s knowledge in chemistry and biochemistry, to provide insight into concepts relating to the chemical basis of drug action in order to make drug therapy decisions. The relationship between the biological target and the drug entity that produces a biological response requires an integrated knowledge of the drug target, the manner in which the drug interacts with the target and factors that provide the drug with a measure of specificity. The course will emphasize the significance of chemical and physicochemical properties as these factors influence the stability, solubility, bioavailability, metabolism, elimination, potency, drug half-life, drug interactions and target interactions (covalent and noncovalent binding) of the drug

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>
    To provide quality education to pharmacy practice and pharmaceutical sciences students at all academic levels, using best practices and evidence-based educational approaches, which enables our graduates to advance their professions To provide an academic environment that promotes effective mentoring, professional growth and development, and life long learning
